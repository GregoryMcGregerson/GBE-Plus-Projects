GBE+ by: shonumi https://github.com/shonumi/gbe-plus

#### How to use these graphic packs.

Place 'Load' Folder in the GBE-plus data folder

Select desired manifest in options/paths/CGFX Manifest



### Known issues
##### SML1:
A lot of the background issues can be fixed with rom hacks. Still waiting for GBE+ to impliment cheats or IPS patching to resolve this.
Also hoping for changing graphics if certain values in RAM are equal to specific values. That will fix fire Mario to be the right color when the RAM value matches the specified value in the manifest and also make it possible to have tiles that are the same hash look different depending on which level data value is in the RAM. Combine that with rom hacks and you can get super detailed levels.
Also hoping for animated textures so I can fix the static question blocks, starman pickup and coins.

##### LAdx:
GBC loading is not working as of yet.
