# GBE-Plus-Projects
CGFX packs for GBE+

Place 'Load' Folder in the GBE-plus data folder

### SML1:
Alot of the background issuses can be fixed with rom hacks. Still waiting for GBE+ to impliment cheats or IPS patching to absolve this.

Also hoping for changing graphics if certain values in RAM are equal to specific values. That will fix fire Mario to be the right color when the RAM vaule matches the specified value in the manifest. And also make it possible to have tiles that are the same hash look different depending on which level data value is in the RAM. Combine that with rom hacks and you can get super detailed levels.

Also hoping for animated textures so I can fix the question blocks, starman pickup and coins.
